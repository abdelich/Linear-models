# Linear-models

In this project we will MANUALLY use basic and fundamental methods of machine learning with help of linear algebra such as:

1) Linear Regression with least-squares error
2) PCA with Singular value decomposition (SVD)
3) Logistic Regression 
4) Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Tasks:
1) Predicting wine quality
2) Dimensionality reduction 
3) Wine classification
